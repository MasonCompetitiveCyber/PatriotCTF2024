# One for you, one for me

### Description
You love to order the same flag every day, but I want a flag as well. How about this, I'll split it with you. I'll take half the bits at random and flip them, keeping them all to myself! No worries, you still have half <3

### Difficulty
5?/10

### Flag
``PCTF{y0u_b3tt3r_sti11_giv3_m3_my_fry}``

### Writeup
If you assume a bit of the plaintext, you now have a biased number of bits being flipped for all the other bits of the ciphertext, this allows you to determine the plaintext with a sufficent number of ciphertexts
