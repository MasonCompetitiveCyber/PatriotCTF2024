We've been after a notorious skiddie who took the "Is it possible to have a completely secure computer system" question a little too literally.

After he found out we were looking for them, they moved to live at the bottom of the ocean in a concrete box to hide from the law.

They sent us this message and executable. Please get their password so we can move forward with our mission.

This pyc was created in python3.11, but you don't need a specific version of python 3 to solve this...
