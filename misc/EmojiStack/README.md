# Emoji Stack - CACI

## Description
Welcome to Emoji Stack, the brand new stack based emoji language!
Instead of other stack based turing machines that use difficult to read and challenging characters like + - and [], Emoji Stack uses our proprietary patent pending emoji system. The details of our implentation is below
 - 游녤: Move the stack pointer one cell to the right
 - 游녣: Move the stack pointer one cell to the left
 - 游녨: Increment the current cell by one, bounded by 255
 - 游녩: Decrement the current cell by one, bounded by 0
 - 游눫: Print the ASCII value of the current cell
 - 游대##: Repeat the previous instruction 0x## times

The Emoji Stack is 256 cells long, with each cell supporting a value between 0 - 255.

As an example, the program "游녨游대47游눫游녤游녨游대68游눫游녤游녨游대20游눫" Would output "Hi!" with the following execution flow:

[**0**, 0, 0, 0]\
游녨游대47\
[**0x48**, 0, 0, 0]\
游눫游녤: H\
[0x48, **0**, 0, 0]\
游녨游대68\
[0x48, **0x69**, 0, 0]\
游눫游녤: i\
[0x48, 0x69, **0**, 0]\
游녨游대20\
[0x48, 0x69, **0x21**, 0]\
游눫: !
