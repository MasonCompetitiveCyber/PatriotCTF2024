On The Run

We've been tracking the adversary for weeks, and he just slipped up and posted this gorgeous high-rise view on his Twitter. His caption was "awesome meeting with a gorgeous view!"
Can you track down his location?
(flag format will be PCTF{< business name of his location >}. Not a street address. If he were in a WeWork space, it would be PCTF{wework}.)

Writeup
1. Use the angle of the Washington monument and the Lincoln monument to identify the general area (behind Teddy Roosevelt island)
2. Use a 3D map view to locate a building that has the relative height and distance from the road to be able to take a photo at that angle and capture a shorter building in front of it.
3. Research the street address and see the name of the meeting space that is hosted there. The "awesome meeting" in the caption indicates which business at this address is the correct one.
